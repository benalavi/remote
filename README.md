Remote
======

Remote is a small tool for running bash scripts on a collection of remote
servers. It consists of a small library which handles compiling and running
bash scripts on remote servers, a "task" library which can be used inside of
rake tasks which adds some conventions, and a handful of common tasks.

Remote is heavily inspired by [relay](https://github.com/soveran/relay) and
[tele](https://github.com/djanowski/tele).
